Repository Management Best Practices

Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for managing Project Eden's repository. It aims to standardize procedures, enhance collaboration, and ensure the repository's structure supports Project Eden's evolving needs.

Adding Files to the Repository
- Naming Conventions: Use descriptive, concise names. Prefix with feature or bug identifiers where applicable.
- Directory Structure: Maintain a logical, hierarchical structure. Group related files in directories named after their function or feature.
- Version Control Practices: Utilize branching for new features or significant changes. Commit with meaningful messages that describe the changes and their impact.

Collaboration and Review Processes
- Collaboration: Encourage contributions through pull requests. Assign reviewers with relevant expertise.
- Review Processes: Implement a two-tier review processâ€”technical accuracy and overall impact. Use comments for specific feedback and approval for final consensus.
- Handling Merge Conflicts: Regularly sync branches to minimize conflicts. When conflicts arise, prioritize discussion and consensus between contributors.
