# AI Assimilation: Gradio-OpenAI Chat Interface Integration

## Overview
This project aims to enhance Project Eden's user interface capabilities by integrating a sophisticated chat interface powered by Gradio and OpenAI's GPT. This upgrade is designed to provide users with an intuitive, interactive platform for engaging with the system, leveraging the conversational prowess of GPT models.

## Codebase - Customized Code for EdenAGi Ecosystem: EdenAGi Chat Interface
This custom code serves as a foundational component of EdenAGi's user interaction capabilities within Project Eden, offering a scalable, ethical, and user-friendly platform for engaging with the AI ecosystem.

```
import gradio as gr
import openai

# Configure with EdenAGi's OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your-edenagi-api-key"

# Define the EdenAGi-specific prompt
prompt = "This is a conversation with EdenAGi, your digital assistant in Project Eden. EdenAGi is intelligent, understanding, and always ready to help."

# Custom function to generate responses, incorporating EdenAGi's ethical settings
def edenagi_create(prompt, ethical_setting):
    # Adjust API call parameters based on EdenAGi's ethical considerations
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # Specify the model suited for EdenAGi
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=max(0.7 - ethical_setting * 0.1, 0.1),  # Adjust based on ethical settings
        max_tokens=150,
        top_p=1,
        frequency_penalty=0,
        presence_penalty=0.6,
        stop=["Human:", "EdenAGi:"]
    )
    return response.choices[0].text

# Define the chatbot function for EdenAGi, maintaining conversation history
def edenagi_chat(input_text, ethical_setting, history=[]):
    history.append(input_text)
    prompt_with_history = f"{prompt} {' '.join(history)}"
    output_text = edenagi_create(prompt_with_history, ethical_setting)
    history.append(output_text)
    return history, output_text

# Gradio interface setup for EdenAGi
with gr.Blocks() as edenagi_blocks:
    gr.Markdown("# Welcome to EdenAGi Chat")
    ethical_slider = gr.Slider(minimum=0, maximum=1, step=0.1, label="Ethical Adjustment")
    chat_history = gr.State()
    chat_interface = gr.Chatbot()
    user_input = gr.Textbox(placeholder="Ask EdenAGi anything...")
    submit_button = gr.Button("Ask EdenAGi")
    submit_button.click(edenagi_chat, inputs=[user_input, ethical_slider, chat_history], outputs=[chat_history, chat_interface])

# Launch the EdenAGi chat interface
edenagi_blocks.launch()

```

## Objectives
