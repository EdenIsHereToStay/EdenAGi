# Step-by-Step Guide to Install and Run Open Interpreter

## Prerequisites

1. **Miniconda Installation**
   - Download the Miniconda installer from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - Ensure you select the option to add Miniconda to your PATH environment variable.

## Step 1: Verify Miniconda Installation

1. Open the command prompt.
2. Type the following command to verify the installation:

```sh
conda --version
```

You should see the version of conda displayed. If not, ensure Miniconda is added to your PATH.

## Step 2: Create a Conda Environment for Open Interpreter

1. Open the command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to set up the environment:

```sh
cd C:\EdenAGi\EdenAGi\src\aiModels\O1
```

3. Create a new conda environment with Python 3.9:

```sh
conda create -n oi python=3.9
```

4. When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to proceed.

5. Activate the environment:

```sh
conda activate oi
```

## Step 3: Install Open Interpreter

1. Within the activated environment, install Open Interpreter:

```sh
pip install open-interpreter
```

## Step 4: Run Open Interpreter

1. Start the Open Interpreter:

```sh
interpreter
```

2. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted.

## Step 5: Set Up Environment Variable for OpenAI API Key

To avoid entering your API key every time, set it as an environment variable:

- **Windows:**

```sh
setx OPENAI_API_KEY your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key.
