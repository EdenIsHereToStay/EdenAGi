## 1. Introduction

Project EdenAGI is an advanced AGI system that integrates a multitude of AI technologies into a self-sufficient, autonomous, and open-source ecosystem. The system is designed with modularity and adaptability at its core, allowing it to function across various hardware platforms and interact with a range of software tools.

## 2. File System Structure

The file system of Project EdenAGI is organized to support the complex workflow of the system's components. It is structured as follows:

- `/src`: Contains the source code for all AI agents, including SystemsEngineerGPT, and the core systems of EdenAGI.
- `/data`: Houses the dynamic data generated and utilized by the system, including output from AI agents and input from users.
- `/scripts`: Stores scripts for automation and utilities that facilitate system operations.
- `/docs`: Includes all documentation related to system design, usage protocols, and development guides.
- `/tests`: Contains test suites and testing protocols to ensure system reliability and performance.

## 3. Usage Protocols

### 3.1. User Interaction

Users can interact with Project EdenAGI through a designated user interface that allows for input submission, system monitoring, and receiving output from the AI agents. Detailed guidelines for user interaction are provided in the system's UI documentation.

### 3.2. AI Agent Integration

AI agents within EdenAGI are designed to operate both independently and interdependently, with the ability to create and manage subsystems autonomously. Each agent follows strict protocols for data handling, task execution, and inter-agent communication.

### 3.3. Engineering Rounds

Engineering Rounds form the cyclical operational process of EdenAGI, facilitating the flow of tasks and information between AI agents. These rounds are initiated by the SystemsEngineerGPT and involve the following steps:

1. Task Initiation: SystemsEngineerGPT initiates a task based on system goals or user input.
2. Task Distribution: The task is encapsulated in a prompt template and distributed to relevant AI agents.
3. Processing and Synthesis: AI agents process the task and return their output to SystemsEngineerGPT.
4. Data Integration: SystemsEngineerGPT synthesizes the outputs and updates the system's data accordingly.

### 3.4. Data Management

Data within EdenAGI is meticulously managed to ensure integrity and continuity. SystemsEngineerGPT oversees the storage of data in the `/data` directory, with protocols in place for version control, data retrieval, and secure backup operations.

## 4. Compliance and Security

Project EdenAGI operates in strict adherence to OpenAI's Updated Usage Policies and GPT Brand Guidelines. The system is designed to prevent any activities that could promote or enable harmful content. Security measures are implemented at every level to safeguard the system and user data.

## 5. System Maintenance

Regular system maintenance is conducted to keep EdenAGI up-to-date and functioning optimally. This includes:

- Updating AI models and algorithms.
- Patching security vulnerabilities.
- Refining data management protocols.
- Enhancing user interaction interfaces.

## 6. Conclusion

Project EdenAGI represents the pinnacle of autonomous AI system development. Through its sophisticated design and operational protocols, it offers a glimpse into the future of AGI, where systems are not just tools but collaborators in the pursuit of innovation and knowledge.
