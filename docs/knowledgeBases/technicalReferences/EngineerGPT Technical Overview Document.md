## EngineerGPT Technical Overview Document

### Introduction
EngineerGPT is an advanced AI assistant specifically designed to enhance and streamline software development processes. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, it can generate, refactor, document, and debug code based on user prompts. This document provides an in-depth overview of EngineerGPT, detailing its capabilities, installation, usage, and technical specifications.

### Key Features
- **Code Generation**: Automatically create new code snippets or entire project structures from user prompts.
- **Code Refactoring**: Analyze and improve existing code for better performance, readability, and maintainability.
- **Technical Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation for codebases, including inline comments and external documentation files.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Assist with identifying bugs, suggesting fixes, and generating test cases to ensure code reliability.

### Technical Specifications
#### Requirements
- **Operating Systems**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Python**: Python 3.8 or later.
- **Dependencies**: Various Python libraries and API keys from OpenAI or other LLM providers.

#### Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer.git
   cd gpt-engineer
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Rename `example.env` to `.env`:
     ```sh
     mv example.env .env
     ```
   - Add your API keys to the `.env` file.

4. **Run the Framework**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage Modes
- **Default Mode**: Operates using GPT-4.
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
- **Claude 3 Mode**:
  ```sh
  python main.py --model claude-3
  ```
- **LLM Specific Mode**:
  ```sh
  python main.py --model llm-specific
  ```

### How It Works
EngineerGPT utilizes LLMs to process natural language prompts and translate them into executable code. By analyzing the context and requirements provided by the user, it can generate code snippets, refactor existing code, or provide detailed explanations and documentation.

### Example Usage
1. **Code Generation**:
   - Prompt: "Generate a Python script to sort a list of integers."
   - Output: A fully functional Python script implementing a sorting algorithm.

2. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Input: Existing code that needs optimization.
   - Output: Improved code with better performance and readability.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Input: Codebase without comments or documentation.
   - Output: Detailed inline comments and an external documentation file.

4. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Prompt: "Find and fix the bug in this JavaScript function."
   - Output: Identified bug and suggested fix, along with test cases.
