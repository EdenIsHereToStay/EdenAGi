        #### 6. Driver Structure Example
        ```
        {
        "applicationName": "ExampleApp",
        "version": "1.0",
        "commands": [
            {
            "command": "start",
            "description": "Initiates the application.",
            "parameters": [],
            "response": "Application started."
            },
            {
            "command": "performAction",
            "description": "Performs a specified action within the application.",
            "parameters": ["actionName"],
            "response": "Action completed."
            }
        ],
        "errorHandling": [
            {
            "error": "ApplicationError",
            "description": "General application error.",
            "resolution": "Restart the application."
            }
        ],
        "integrationPoints": [
            {
            "api": "/api/action",
            "method": "POST",
            "description": "Endpoint to perform actions."
            }
        ]
        }


        ### 7. Continuous Improvement
