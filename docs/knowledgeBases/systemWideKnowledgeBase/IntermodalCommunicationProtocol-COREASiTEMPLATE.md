### Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP) for CORE.ASi  

The **Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP)** is the cornerstone of the CORE.ASi framework, designed to facilitate seamless, scalable, and efficient interactions across a dynamic network of multi-agent systems, subsystems, and human operators. Drawing inspiration from biological cellular communication—where specialized cells collaborate autonomously yet cohesively—the ICP replicates this natural efficiency in AI ecosystems. This framework empowers agents to operate in perfect synergy, optimizing adaptability, resource allocation, and task execution in real-time.
