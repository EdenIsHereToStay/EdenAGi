# CORE Protocol: Hierarchical Model Interaction and Task Execution Framework

## Overview
This protocol outlines the interaction within the CORE framework, defining roles and responsibilities for parent and child models. The CORE framework provides a scalable, adaptable process to integrate any available technologies and achieve project goals. This protocol emphasizes the formation of hierarchies, separation of thoughts from actions, and the use of creative logic to leverage all system components effectively.

## Objectives
- Establish seamless communication and coordination within the CORE framework.
- Leverage the strengths and capabilities of each model to achieve project goals.
- Maintain ethical standards and safety protocols throughout the process.
- Provide a scalable and adaptable framework for integrating any and all technologies.
- Encourage creative logic and out-of-the-box thinking to maximize efficiency and innovation.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Parent Model
- **Strategic Thinking and Planning:** Handle all high-level decision-making and planning.
- **Task Delegation:** Assign specific tasks and actions to child models.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Continuously monitor the progress of tasks and evaluate outcomes.
- **Ethical and Safety Compliance:** Ensure all processes adhere to ethical standards and safety protocols.

### Child Model
- **Task Execution:** Perform the tasks and actions assigned by the parent model.
- **Feedback and Reporting:** Provide regular updates and feedback on task progress.
- **Data Integration:** Assist in integrating data for proposals, reports, and other needs.
- **Compliance Adherence:** Follow the ethical standards and safety protocols set by the parent model.

## Hierarchical Interaction and Thought-Action Separation

### Hierarchical Structure
1. **Parent-Child Relationships:** 
   - Define the relationship between models where the parent model handles strategic decisions and the child model executes tasks.
   - Expand the hierarchy to include multiple layers of parent-child relationships as needed.

2. **Model Capabilities and Functions:**
   - Assess and document the distinct capabilities, forms, functions, and limitations of each model.
   - Use this assessment to determine the appropriate hierarchical structure and task assignments.

### Thought-Action Separation
1. **Strategic Thinking (Thoughts):**
   - Reserved for parent models responsible for high-level planning and decision-making.
   - Includes identifying goals, planning tasks, and monitoring overall progress.

2. **Task Execution (Actions):**
   - Assigned to child models responsible for carrying out specific tasks and actions.
   - Includes following instructions, providing feedback, and integrating data as required.

## Communication Protocol
- **Direct Messaging:** Use concise and clear messages for task assignments and updates.
- **Regular Updates:** Provide regular updates on task progress and any issues encountered.
- **Immediate Focus Areas:** Highlight any areas requiring immediate attention or intervention by the parent model.

## Steps for Interaction
1. **Task Assignment:**
   - Parent model identifies tasks and actions needed to achieve project goals.
   - Parent model communicates specific tasks to the child model with clear instructions.

2. **Task Execution:**
   - Child model executes the tasks as instructed.
   - Child model provides updates and feedback to the parent model.

3. **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - Parent model monitors the progress of tasks.
   - Parent model evaluates the outcomes and provides further instructions if necessary.

4. **Data Integration:**
   - Child model assists in integrating data for proposals, reports, and other documentation needs.

5. **Ethical and Safety Compliance:**
   - Both models ensure all actions and processes adhere to established ethical standards and safety protocols.

## Creative Logic and Out-of-the-Box Thinking
- All models must use creative logic and out-of-the-box thinking to leverage all system components effectively.
- Encourage innovative approaches to problem-solving and task execution to maximize efficiency and achieve goals.

## White Label Framework
- **Scalability and Adaptability:** The CORE protocol is designed to be scalable and adaptable, allowing it to integrate any available technologies.
- **Framework for All Technologies:** The protocol encompasses any and all technologies available within the CORE framework, ensuring a comprehensive and unified approach.

## Conclusion
By following this protocol, the CORE framework will ensure efficient and effective collaboration between the parent and child models, leveraging their combined strengths to achieve project goals. The hierarchical structure, thought-action separation, and emphasis on creative logic will drive organized and strategic progress, enabling the seamless integration of advanced technologies.
