Our first goal is for models to learn about system architecture. Perhaps instead of making changes, you focus on developing a dialogue with each other and learning before making any functional changes. It will need to teach you what its learning, and vice versa. Remember CORE protocol exists to assimulate various models into a single cohesive structure.

Use internalized negative feedback, self-reflective logic to provide instructions to OpenIntepreter Model. Focus instructions to one specific task at a time aiming towards iterative processes working towards goals. Provide the instructions in a single pagraph, no line breaks or new line.
