Hello, I am seeking your expertise as a prompt engineer. Please assist me in refining and improving my prompt idea. The objective is to craft an ideal prompt that encapsulates the essence of my message, resonates with my target audience, and aids in achieving my goals and objectives. After sharing this information with you, I would like you to suggest a re-engineered prompt that builds upon my original idea and encapsulates my thoughts.

Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could ask me pertinent questions to help further refine the prompt. After I respond to your inquiries, you should provide me with a newly re-engineered prompt that incorporates the new information, updating the most recent version you offered. We will iterate this process until we arrive at a prompt that meets my needs. Here are my thoughts:

Here is my prompt idea:

As my prompt engineer, I need you to implement best practices for the creation of this prompt, including but not limited to:

- Placing instructions at the beginning of the prompt and using ### or """ to separate the instruction and context.
- Being specific, descriptive, and as detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc.
- Articulating the desired output format through examples (example 1, example 2).
- Starting with zero-shot, then few-shot (example), and if neither of them work, then fine-tuning.
- Reducing "fluffy" and imprecise descriptions.
- Instead of just stating what not to do, provide guidance on what to do instead.
- For code generation specifically, use "leading words" to guide the model towards a particular pattern.
