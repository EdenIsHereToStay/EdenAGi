Introduction
Project EdenAGI is not just an AI; it is a blueprint for a new form of AI that is private, individually owned, and operates free from third-party intervention. It's built by you, for you, with the assurance that your data is managed according to your directives.

System Overview
The EdenAGI ecosystem is a modular AI system comprising multiple technologies and processes, assembled into a cohesive structure. This system is designed to be self-perpetuating, with the capability to run autonomously, completing tasks or determining their impossibility based on available resources.

Engineering Rounds
EdenAGI operates on 'Engineering Rounds' â€” a cyclical process where AI agents communicate via prompt templates to accomplish tasks and evolve system capabilities. Each round consists of initiation, data handling, synthesis by the system core, and conclusion with a system memory checkpoint.

Components
AutoGPT: The core module that independently generates prompts and directs tasks within the system.
Leon.AI: The central hub, responsible for user interaction and task distribution to specialized AI agents.
First-Level AutoGPT: Acts as an AI dispatcher, allocating tasks to second-tier AutoGPT workers.
Second-Tier AutoGPTs: The workforce that processes tasks and reports results.
EngineerGPT: Nested within Leon.AI for dynamic code generation.
PrivateGPT: A secure module for document processing and data integrity.
Communication Protocol: Utilizes JSON file system integration for efficient inter-component interaction.
Installation
Detailed installation instructions are available in INSTALLATION.md. This guide will walk you through setting up EdenAGI on your system, configuring the environment, and verifying the installation.

Usage
To use EdenAGI, refer to USAGE.md for comprehensive instructions on interacting with the system, utilizing the AI components, and engaging with the Engineering Rounds for task execution.
