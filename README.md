## System Overview
The architecture of EdenAGI is a modular and comprehensive AI ecosystem, constructed to be self-sufficient. It is capable of autonomously executing complex tasks and making informed decisions based on the resources at hand and set directives.

### Detailed Components Analysis
Project EdenAGI encompasses several critical components, each playing a vital role in the system's autonomy and functionality:
- **AutoGPT**: Serves as the central intelligence unit, generating autonomous prompts and managing task executions within the system.
- **Leon.AI**: Acts as the user interface and operational hub, orchestrating task allocation throughout the AI network.
- **First-Level AutoGPT**: Functions as an AI task dispatcher, directing tasks to specific second-tier AutoGPT agents based on their specialization.
- **Second-Tier AutoGPTs**: Comprises specialized AI agents focused on executing assigned tasks and reporting outcomes.
- **EngineerGPT**: A part of the Leon.AI framework, tasked with generating dynamic code in real-time to facilitate system updates and enhancements.
- **PrivateGPT**: Ensures the privacy and security of document processing within the ecosystem, safeguarding sensitive data.
- **Communication Protocol**: Utilizes an efficient JSON file system for seamless and coherent communication between components.
