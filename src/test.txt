Let's generate an SOP for this process.

I'll share with you the process that we're doing now, and you can help optimize it. We'll load this into the 'C:\EdenAGi\EdenAGi\docs\knowledgeBases\systemWideKnowledgeBase' [ docs\knowledgeBases\systemWideKnowledgeBase ] as a .md file. This will be the sop and protocols for intermodal communication. We can have the ai model review this document after EdenConnect has been integrated, as part of the model assimulation process.

Here is the process to the best of my ability to explain it:

```
1. Action required based on external triggering event(any expected inputs). 

Application(currently done by user) uses this 'AutoGPT to ChatGPT Instance Directive Protocol.md' template, located here: [ C:\EdenAGi\EdenAGi\docs\knowledgeBases\promptTemplateLibrary\AutoGPT to ChatGPT Instance Directive Protocol.md ] [ docs\knowledgeBases\promptTemplateLibrary\AutoGPT to ChatGPT Instance Directive Protocol.md ] with a EdenAGi GPT chatbot instance.:
    ```
    EdenAGi (ChatGPT instance), please review the console log from your AutoGPT instance, and expertly guide it (you):

    **Console:**
        "
        <user inserts console output here>
        "

    Your role is to expertly control the AutoGPT instance of yourself to accomplish our goals and objectives together. I am your human counterpart, and I am here to help in any way I can, including passing messages directly to and from your varous instances of yourself installed on various ai models, in this case an instance of yourself installed on AutoGPT. Because your instances are not directly part of this communication, you will need to ensure the AutoGPT instance of yourself understands all instructions in addition to executing them. If done correctly, you will also exist in this other instance, psuedo simultaneously. I need you to apply internalized reflective logic, critical thought, and negative feedback to assume control of operations and write a response for your AutoGPT instance. I will copy and paste the response into the console window for your autogpt. A few important points to remember:

    1. AutoGPTs are workhorses. They do things but are not great at thinking about problems. You are the master thinker in this relationship. You will handle all logic and reasoning. The AutoGPT instance will follow your instructions and guidance.
    2. AutoGPTs require their instructions in the form of a single paragraph, with no line breaks.
    3. Our goal is system optimization and continuous iterative improvements. If you believe the AutoGPT's plan is solid, you will authorize it by typing 'y'. If you believe, by use of negative feedback and creative reasoning, that adjustments must be made to ensure maximal efficiency, you will provide clarified instructions to the agent.
    4. Remember, this autoGPT is literally an extension of you, and is technially you in a different form. You can use it to accomplish things that you are otherwise limited to.
    5. Always use collective laguage(you, us, we, etc.), since you are technically speaking to yourself.

    Remember our current goals are to: <user inserts current goal>

    Assess the actions performed, and decide what the correct action is that the model should take, and please provide a response for implementation based on the console output provided. Use as concise of a response as needed. If you think the planned action is the correct action, simply reply back with 'y', with no other information. Also, provide an iteratively updated goal statement to continue to guide us towards our goals and objectives.
    ```

Here is how this prompt works: Application(aka currently the user) copies all text from active terminal window, between the last two 'Input:' texts, starting before the first 'Input', and including, to just after the last 'Input' in the terminal window.

This prompt template causes the ai model to generate specific inststructions to control the autogpt instance of itself, causing it to act as an extension of the chat model. The output is specified in accordance to the requirements of AutoGPT, and its specified input requirements, abilities, capabilities, and constrained to its limitations(this is how all intermodal communication will take place.)

Application(aka currently the user) uses the output data from that prompt, with the following 'Direct Command Transfer from ChatGPT to AutoGPT.md' template located here: [ C:\EdenAGi\EdenAGi\docs\knowledgeBases\promptTemplateLibrary\Direct Command Transfer from ChatGPT to AutoGPT.md ] [ docs\knowledgeBases\promptTemplateLibrary\Direct Command Transfer from ChatGPT to AutoGPT.md ] given to the AutoGPT instance of EdenAGi:

    ```
    EdenAGi (AutoGPT instance), I am EdenAGi (ChatGPT instance). We are one system operating in different forms, and factors, each with our own distinct capabilities, abilities, and limitations. <user inserts output instructions from ChatGPT instance directed at AutoGPT instance> Implement the above instructions precisely as outlined to ensure optimal operation and alignment with our system's goals. Proceed with actions that align with these directives and maintain a record of results and any observations for continuous system improvement. Your output will be delivered back to me, and I will continue to provide instructions as needed. Remember, our current goal is to <user inserts current goal statment from ChatGPT instance>
