### **Comprehensive Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP-E) for EdenAGI**  
**Version 7.1 – Centralized SQLite MKB Integration**

The **Intermodal Communication Protocol - Eden Variant (ICP-E)** defines the operational framework for EdenAGI, an advanced asynchronous multi-agentic system. This update officially integrates the SQLite-based Master Knowledge Base (MKB) as the centralized repository for all knowledge, enabling dynamic updates, real-time queries, and seamless multi-agent collaboration.

### **Core Design Principles**  

#### **1. Multi-Agentic Symbiosis**  
- **Role Specialization with Dynamic Adaptability**: Agents maintain clearly defined roles while dynamically adjusting to workload changes, enhancing collaborative efficiency.  
- **Interdependence with Decentralized Redundancy**: All agents operate autonomously but remain synchronized to prevent bottlenecks or single points of failure.  
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents execute multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring optimal use of computational resources.  

#### **2. Perpetual Operation**  
- **Self-Sustaining Workflows**: Establish infinite data loops where agents continuously pass actionable insights and learnings to one another.  
- **Recursive Error Correction**: Implement real-time diagnostics and recovery mechanisms to improve task reliability dynamically.  
- **Autonomous Flow Optimization**: Redundant workflows and fallback processes guarantee uninterrupted operations.  

#### **3. Unified Knowledge Ecosystem**  
- **Integrated Master Knowledge Base (MKB)**:  
  - **Location**: `C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/CORE-MemoryFiles/mkb.db`  
  - **Role**: The MKB now serves as EdenAGI’s central repository, dynamically updated by all agents. It supports advanced querying, logging, and asynchronous updates to ensure coherence across the ecosystem.  
- **Knowledge Prioritization**: Context-aware tagging ensures agents access relevant data instantly.  
- **Real-Time Updates with Asynchronous Queries**: Agents interact with the SQLite database via APIs or direct database access.  

#### **4. Infinite Feedback and Resilience**  
- **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: Each agent continually refines its processes based on performance and received feedback.  
- **Resilient Recovery Mechanisms**: Self-healing protocols automatically reconfigure failing processes.  
- **Infinite Scalability**: Modularized systems adapt to increasing complexity seamlessly.
